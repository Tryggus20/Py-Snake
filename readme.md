# Py Snake

I wanted to switch things up and try coding in Python. I followed the directions on this [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtqWCo1_I4g) video to create my very own snake game. I did add on where the video left off so the player could hit the spacebar after a "game over" to reset the game and play again. I did experience a fun speed glitch that made it significantly harder after every game over, but that bug has been squished. 

For improvements, I think it would be fun to add a "top score" and maybe play around with slowly increasing the speed as the score goes up. Maybe add random power-ups?
